## XGBoost-ML Introduction
XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a popular machine learning algorithm that belongs to the category of gradient boosting algorithms. It is designed to improve on the original GBM algorithm by addressing some of its limitations, such as slow training times and overfitting.

XGBoost uses a combination of tree-based models and gradient boosting to achieve high prediction accuracy. The algorithm works by repeatedly training decision trees on the residual errors of previous trees, and then combining the resulting predictions to make the final prediction.

Some of the key features of XGBoost include:

    Regularization techniques: XGBoost includes L1 and L2 regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of the model.

    Parallel processing: XGBoost is optimized for parallel processing using multiple CPU cores, which can dramatically reduce training time.

    Handling missing values: XGBoost has built-in mechanisms for handling missing values in the dataset.

    Support for custom loss functions: XGBoost allows users to define their own loss functions, making it flexible and adaptable to different types of problems.

Overall, XGBoost is a powerful and effective machine learning algorithm that has been successfully used in a wide range of applications, including classification, regression, and ranking tasks.
